# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

### 🧠 **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to identify key factors that influence customer retention and attrition.  
The analysis was performed using **SQL** for data exploration and **Power BI** for visualization and dashboard creation.  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
To understand why customers are leaving the telecom company and provide data-driven insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

### 🗂️ **Dataset Information**

### 🔍 **Analysis Performed (SQL)**  
- Calculated churn rate and retention rate  
- Analyzed churn by contract type, payment method, and internet service  
- Studied customer demographics (age, gender, senior citizen, dependents)  
- Examined tenure and monthly charges in relation to churn  

### 📊 **Dashboard Insights (Power BI)**  
1. **Churn by Contract Type:**  
   - Month-to-month customers show the highest churn (42.7%).  
2. **Customer Demographics:**  
   - Churn is nearly equal across genders; non-senior customers churn slightly more.  
3. **Tenure & Retention:**

4. **Payment Method:**  
   - Electronic check users have the highest churn rate.  
5. **Family Status:**  
   - Customers with partners/dependents show lower churn.
